In the past, I haven't the habit of writing something on the internet, only record the easy forget things into my OneNote or Evernote books, because I think this would take me much more time on it, but now I think it's meaningful since I've got many free answers from the internet.

Why I wrote this in English? The answer is:
> I want to practice my English.

For the technology articles, they will come from my experiences, it coming soon.
